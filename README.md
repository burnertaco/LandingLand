# LandingLand

OA3801 Final Project

This repository contains the presentation and code for our project on optimizing the process of land investing.
The project focused on:
   - Defining hot markets where land sells quickly
   - Building an automated pricing model to generate accurate offer prices
   - Using automation (LLM parsing) to clean and format mailing lists
   - 
The goal was to reduce marketing waste, improve lead quality, and increase overall profitability for land investors.
